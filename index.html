      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Centereach, Long Island in the State of New
      York. This is where I lived all my life until coming to UB, and it is
      where a majority of my friends are and so it was really difficult to make
      the move up here. My home is over 500 miles from this campus.

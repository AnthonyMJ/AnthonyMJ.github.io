    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is Anthony Joy. I am a CSE Major attending the SUNY at
      Buffalo. I, as long as I don't fuck up, will be graduating with the class
      of 2020. I enjoy video games, camping, soccer, and spendinding time with
      friends. I am an associate member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity and
      will be offically inducted as of Sunday, Oct. 16th.
      </p>
      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Centereach, Long Island in the State of New
      York. This is where I lived all my life until coming to UB, and it is
      where a majority of my friends are and so it was really difficult to make
      the move up here. My home is over 500 miles from this campus.
    </p>

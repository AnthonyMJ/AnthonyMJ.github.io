    <h1>Manatees: A Majestic Sea Creature!</h1>
      <h2>Manatee Fun Facts</h2>
      <p>Manatees, although called the cows of the sea are actually most closely
        related to elephants. This can easily be noticed when you look at the
        fingernails, both creatures have 3 to 4 fingernails.
        As manatees are marine mammals they breath through their nostrils.

      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <p>I was born and raised in Centereach, Long Island in the State of New
      York. This is where I lived all my life until coming to UB, and it is
      where a majority of my friends are and so it was really difficult to make
      the move up here. My home is over 500 miles from this campus.
